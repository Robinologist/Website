            <p>Although math isn't my best subject, I really enjoy programming. In 2023, I started teaching myself the
                <i>Unity</i> game engine to explore making games, and have since amassed a wealth of small coding projects and game prototypes all while learning new techniques.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of those exploratory projects and what they've taught me:</p>

                    <p>While working on this first project, I learned about <i>finite state machines</i> and about how
                        rhythm games synchronize events along the musical measurements of beats and bars. I also greatly
                        improved my pixel art and animation skills throughout the project's development.</p>

                        <i>inverse kinematics</i> to simulate the leg movements of 2D centipede and spider sillhouettes.

            <p>Once I was satisfied with my recreation, I began pivoting to a deckbuilder game, implementing features like unique card effects, a mana system, and damageable enemies!</p>
            <p>I spent a lot of time polishing this vertical slice, making sure that hovering and dragging on every element felt as good as possible. It was super fun to work on shaders too, from the background swirls and CRT scanlines to the transparency system behind shadow overlapping.</p>

                    <p>My latest project (as of January 2026) has been a little 2D grid-based puzzler. Taking heavy inspiration from indie game <i>Steven's Sausage Roll</i>, my game consists of puzzles in which you must push, pull, and rotate differently-shaped blocks to cover all of the yellow goal tiles in a level.</p>

            <p>This project has been the culmination of a lot of previously-mentioned techniques; grid-based movement logic, smooth animations driven by bézier curves, tiling shader-graph backgrounds, and more! And that's not to mention the soundtrack I composed and sound effects I recorded and edited.</p>

                    <p>I'm particularly proud of my level saving and loading system; I learned how to read from and write to text files so that I could store every level layout as JSON, able to be loaded into the game world at any time.</p>
                    <p>On the designing side, I made a custom inspector that allows me to easily put together levels, moving and rotating level parts on the grid with a simple per-object control panel.</p>
