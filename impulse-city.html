        <p>Since around age six, I've been attending a local summer-camp called Impulse City annually, initially as a camper, now a counselor. Every summer, a couple of weeks at the camp are devoted to the campers creating and performing their own film adaptation of one of the <i>Harry Potter</i> books.</p>
        <p>As I've gotten older, I've steadily taken on more volunteer roles and responsibilities for these films, starting with vfx work and now including writing, directing, and cinematography.</p>
