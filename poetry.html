                    <h2>Melting Down</h2>
                    <i>– Nov 13, 2025 –</i>
                    <p>It’s not really about the wax, solidifying into the grain of my carpet as we speak. It’s not about the stain, even though the carpet was new and your novel embellishment of bright blue clashes like crazy with my rust-colored walls. I think if you took the time to scrape off each clumped tuft in apology, you would find that inside the pile of vivid clippings there is still an argument to be finished, something infuriatingly trivial and unwinnable as us two asses pull at the same rope in different directions. But it’s not really about that argument, frozen in opaque amber and saved for a rainy day when the heat of a different anger might defrost it, or about any of our arguments; the lighthouse, the piano rental, the holiday parking garage. Because in reality, I am annoyed about the wax. I’m annoyed that you thought to set up candles for our dinner and I didn’t, annoyed that I was late and let you down despite leaving work early, and annoyed that everything that could have possibly gone wrong did and our fresh start now smells like burnt rug.</p>

                    <p>There is a dark so profound that even silence is smothered.</p>
                    <p>A dark which melts down to smear across every crevice, every scrape and bump and divit</p>
                    <p>of my nails and of my face. It extinguishes the sound</p>
                    <p>of the drops dripping from my paddle to the pool. It extinguishes the sound</p>
                    <p>of my haggard prayers.</p>
                    <p>The prayers of a sinner seeking solace.</p>
                    <p>And from heaven there comes a call.</p>
                    <p>Down it falls, a word clattering along the rocks,</p>
                    <p>dangling on its string, bruised from the walls and too weak to fly by the time</p>
                    <p>it reaches me.</p>
                    <p>“Hello!” I crow back in its voice. “Hello! Hello!”</p>
                    <p>The sounds flee from my cracked lips;</p>
                    <p>I do not deserve them, they know this. They know. And so they rise,</p>
                    <p>shaking off the ties of my wretchedness</p>
                    <p>to return to paradise.</p>
                    <p>The miracle repeats, a new tattered blessing from above</p>
                    <p>gently crumples onto my ground.</p>
                    <p>And so I raise my joyous teeth to the sky and repeat it back.</p>
